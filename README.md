## ⚡ Engineering Philosophy
I focus on reducing accidental complexity before introducing structural complexity.
My work emphasizes clear domain boundaries and well-defined responsibilities to keep systems maintainable and adaptable over time.

Gamification and feedback loops are recurring design elements in my projects, used to make system behavior visible and to support user engagement and learning.

I prefer systems to start small and grow based on real requirements.
Well-designed, clearly scoped systems tend to scale more reliably than oversized solutions with unclear boundaries.

Software should be readable first, clever second.
